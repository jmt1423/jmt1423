## Hi, Iâ€™m @jmt1423!

I am a software developer mainly in full-stack web development, and I also love building and learning about convolutional neural networks!

I have worked as a research assistant and PhD student building CNN's for Lancaster University and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, but have focused more on software engineering for the past year and a half.
