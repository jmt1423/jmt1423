## Hi, Iâ€™m @jmt1423!

I am a full-stack web developer, and I also love building and learning about convolutional neural networks!

I have worked as a research assistant and PhD student building Wavelet based CNN's for Lancaster University and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, but have changed focus to full-stack development.
