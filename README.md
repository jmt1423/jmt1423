## Hi, Iâ€™m @jmt1423!

I am a current PhD candidate in spatial statistics. My current research area is in time series analysis of beach morphodynamics and building models to predict long-term beach erosion.

My current areas of interest are:
  1. Spatial Modelling
  2. Machine Learning
  3. Computer Vision

I'd be happy to hear any collaboration ideas you have,
