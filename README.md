## Hi, Iâ€™m @jmt1423!

I am a full-stack web developer, and I also love building and learning about convolutional neural networks!

I have worked as a research assistant and PhD student building Wavelet based CNN's for Lancaster University and the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, but have focused more on software engineering for the past year and a half.
